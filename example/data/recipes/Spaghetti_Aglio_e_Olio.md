1. Cook spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.  
2. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sliced garlic and cook until lightly golden, being careful not to burn it.  
3. Add chili flakes and stir for 30 seconds.  
4. Toss the drained pasta into the skillet with the garlic oil. Add a splash of the reserved pasta water to create a light sauce.  
5. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.  
6. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and, if desired, grated Parmesan. Serve immediately.
