- Error dialog for "Cannot edit ingredient" lacks transient parent despite the code being set in pantry.rs. Investigate at some point
- The UI constants were thrown in there rather blindly. May need to be better structured to avoid nasty surprises in the future
- UI looks like butt. Adawaita can only do so much
- Markdown support for recipes (read/write) and knowledge base (read-only)
- Tests. Especially unit tests on the engine
- An icon for the window (X is currently givin' it to ya)
- Help docs
- About + license (MIT engine, GPL app)
- Settings
  - Like what?
- Translations! All ingredients should be language-agnostic (how?)
