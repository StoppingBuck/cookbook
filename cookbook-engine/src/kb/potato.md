### Potato
**Potatoes** are root vegetables that are native to the Andes mountains in South America. They are a staple food in many cultures and are known for their versatility in cooking.

They are rich in carbohydrates and provide a good source of energy. Potatoes can be prepared in many ways, including boiling, baking, frying, and mashing. They are often used as a side dish or as an ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.
