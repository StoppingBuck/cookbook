# 🐔 Chicken: The Universal Protein

## 📜 A Brief History

The chicken (*Gallus gallus domesticus*) was domesticated from the red junglefowl native to Southeast Asia approximately 8,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests chickens were initially raised for cockfighting and religious purposes rather than food.

By 3000 BCE, chickens had spread to the Indus Valley and on to the Middle East. The Romans further expanded chicken husbandry throughout their empire, valuing both the meat and eggs. During the Middle Ages, chicken became a staple in European monasteries where monks selectively bred them for improved egg production.

Today, chicken is the most widely consumed meat globally, with over 23 billion chickens raised annually for food. Its popularity stems from its versatility, relatively low cost, and religious acceptance across most cultures.

## 🛒 Storage & Prep Tips

- **Refrigeration**: Store raw chicken for 1-2 days at most before cooking.
- **Freezing**: Raw chicken keeps in the freezer for up to 9 months; cooked, 2-6 months.
- **Defrosting**: Always thaw in the refrigerator, not at room temperature.
- **Cross-contamination**: Use separate cutting boards and wash hands thoroughly after handling.
- **Temperature**: Cook chicken to internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
- **Brining**: Soaking in salt solution improves moisture retention and flavor.
- **Resting**: Let cooked chicken rest 5-10 minutes before cutting to retain juices.

## 💡 Quick Tips

- For juicier breast meat, brine before cooking or cook to just 155°F (68°C) and let rest (carryover cooking will bring it to safe temperature).
- Save bones to make stock—simmer with vegetable scraps and aromatics.
- Pounding breasts to even thickness ensures more uniform cooking.
- When stir-frying, slice chicken against the grain and marinate briefly for tenderness.
- For the crispiest skin, start with very dry skin and roast at high temperature.
- Poaching is ideal for chicken destined for salads and sandwiches—gentle cooking keeps it moist.
- Spatchcocking (butterfly-cutting) a whole chicken reduces cooking time and ensures even cooking.

From simple homecooked meals to complex restaurant preparations, chicken adapts to virtually every culinary tradition, technique, and flavor profile.
