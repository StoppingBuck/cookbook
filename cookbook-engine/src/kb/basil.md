# 🌿 Basil: The Royal Herb

## 📜 A Brief History

Basil (*Ocimum basilicum*) has a rich history spanning over 4,000 years. Originally native to tropical regions of Asia, primarily India, it spread to the Middle East and Mediterranean in ancient times. The name "basil" derives from the Greek word "basileus," meaning "king," reflecting its revered status.

In ancient Egypt, basil was used in embalming rituals, while in ancient Greece and Rome, it symbolized both hatred and love in different contexts. In India, basil (particularly holy basil or tulsi) has been venerated for millennia in Hindu tradition as a sacred plant embodying the goddess Lakshmi.

Basil arrived in Western Europe through trade routes in the 16th century and was brought to the Americas by early colonists. Today, it's cultivated worldwide and is particularly associated with Italian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines.
