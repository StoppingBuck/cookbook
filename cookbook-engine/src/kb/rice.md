# 🍚 Rice: The Global Grain

## 📜 A Brief History

Rice (*Oryza sativa* and *Oryza glaberrima*) has been cultivated for over 10,000 years, making it one of humanity's oldest domesticated crops. Archaeological evidence points to its domestication in the Pearl River valley region of China around 8000-5000 BCE.

Two major subspecies emerged: japonica (short-grain) in East Asia and indica (long-grain) in South Asia. Rice cultivation spread westward through Asia, eventually reaching the Middle East, Africa, and later Europe. Spanish colonists introduced rice to the Americas in the 16th century.

Today, rice is the staple food for more than half of the world's population and is grown on every continent except Antarctica. Over 90% of global rice production occurs in Asia, with China and India as the largest producers.

## 🛒 Storage & Prep Tips

- **Storage**: Store uncooked rice in airtight containers in a cool, dry place.
- **Shelf life**: White rice can last 4-5 years properly stored; brown rice 6-8 months due to oils that can go rancid.
- **Rinsing**: Rinse rice until water runs clear to remove excess starch for fluffier results.
- **Soaking**: Optional but reduces cooking time and improves texture for some varieties.
- **Ratio**: Generally 1:1.5 to 1:2 rice to water ratio, varying by variety.
- **Resting**: Let cooked rice rest 5-10 minutes after cooking for best texture.
- **Refrigeration**: Store cooked rice for up to 4 days, but cool quickly after cooking.

## 💡 Quick Tips

- For fluffier rice, add 1 teaspoon of oil or butter to the cooking water.
- To remove excess starch, toast rice briefly in a dry pan before adding liquid.
- Perfect rice without measuring: add water to cover rice by one knuckle (about 1 inch).
- A tight-fitting lid is essential for properly steamed rice.
- Save leftover rice for fried rice—day-old, refrigerated rice works best.
- Add a bay leaf, cardamom pods, or star anise to the cooking water for subtle aromatics.
- For stuck or burned rice, place a slice of bread on top for 5-10 minutes—it will absorb the burned smell.
