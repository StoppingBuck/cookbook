# 🧅 The Onion: Foundation of Global Cuisine

## 📜 A Brief History

The onion (*Allium cepa*) is one of the oldest cultivated vegetables, with evidence of use dating back more than 7,000 years. Originating in Central Asia, onions have been grown worldwide for millennia due to their long storage life and transportability. 

Ancient Egyptians worshipped onions, believing their concentric rings symbolized eternal life. They were used in burial rituals and depicted in tomb art. In medieval Europe, onions were so valued they served as currency and were given as gifts and rent payments.

Today, onions are cultivated globally and form the aromatic foundation of cuisines on every continent.
