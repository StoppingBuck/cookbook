# 🫒 Olive Oil: Liquid Gold of the Mediterranean

## 📜 A Brief History

Olive oil has been a cornerstone of Mediterranean civilization for over 8,000 years. The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) was likely first domesticated in the Mediterranean basin around 6000 BCE. Archaeological evidence of olive oil production dates back to 4500 BCE in the Levant region.

Ancient Greeks considered olive oil sacred—it was used to anoint kings and athletes and as fuel for the eternal flame of the original Olympic Games. The Romans further expanded olive cultivation throughout their empire and developed more efficient pressing techniques.

By the Middle Ages, olive oil was central to Mediterranean economies, with Venice becoming a major trading hub. The Spanish brought olive cultivation to the Americas in the 16th century. Today, Mediterranean countries still produce about 95% of the world's olive oil, with Spain as the largest producer.

- **Shelf life**: Extra virgin olive oil is best used within 12-18 months of production.
- **Testing freshness**: Fresh olive oil should have a grassy, fruity smell and peppery finish.
- **Buying**: Look for harvest or "best by" dates, dark containers, and PDO/PGI seals for authentic regional oils.

## 💡 Quick Tips

- For maximum flavor and health benefits, use extra virgin olive oil for finishing dishes.
- Despite popular misconceptions, quality extra virgin olive oil has a smoke point of around 375-405°F (190-207°C) and can be used for most cooking methods.
- Store your "everyday" oil conveniently near the stove and your premium oil elsewhere away from heat and light.
- When substituting olive oil for butter in baking, reduce the amount by about 25%.
- In vinaigrettes, use a 3:1 ratio of oil to acid for balanced dressings.
- Warm olive oil slightly before tasting to fully experience its flavor profile.
- Don't discard older olive oil—it's perfect for cooking when flavor has diminished.
